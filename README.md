# DataStructure-CollegeProject
Project created to use common data structures to create a little system to read books datas

### **What structures where used?**
The main goal of this project, whas to create a system to read data from a file, with the best perfomance possible. There is a lot of ways of doing that, here, were used these guys:

- List
- ArrayList
- HashSet
- HashMap
- TreeMap

It wasn't measured the efficiency of the methods (~~actually, I think it was, i just lost the data~~), but i garantee to you that every single one of them, has a purpose. As an example, the HashSet was used to provide us all the distinct words from each book.

### **That's nice, but how do I run the app?**

Well, it's pretty easy actually. You just need books, and a IDE that runs Java. 

- Books

First of all, you need some books, in .txt format, to run the code. It's higly recommended to use books without any kind of accentuation or special characters, because the code doesn't clean the files ~~yet~~. After you got the books, and have put them in a folder, you have to link them on the code, in line 34:
