# DataStructure-CollegeProject
Project created to use common data structures to create a little system to read books datas

### **What structures where used?**
The main goal of this project, whas to create a system to read data from a file, with the best perfomance possible. There is a lot of ways of doing that, here, were used these guys:

- List
- ArrayList
- HashSet
- HashMap
- TreeMap

It wasn't measured the efficiency of the methods (~~actually, I think it was, i just lost the data~~)
